# Repository Purpose Update

Effective immediately, from version `v1.9.0` this repository will be dedicated exclusively to managing **CSGHub Helm Charts**.

## Key Changes
### 1. Docker Installation Removed

As the Docker installation method now only requires the image, related documentation and resources have been removed from this repository.

For the latest installation guide, please refer to:

- ðŸ“š [CSGHub Documentation Center](https://opencsg.com/docs/csghub/101/install/summary)

### 2. Historical Documentation

Legacy documentation can still be accessed via the `release-*` branches.
